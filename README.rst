Juris-M LibreOffice Integration
===============================

This repository contains code for repackaging a compiled release of
the Zotero LibreOffice Integration plugin with version checks that
will permit use with the Juris-M referencing platform, and with a
chooser to prevent both the Juris-M and Zotero versions from being
installed simultaneously.

The original source code of the Zotero plugin (with Affero GPL license)
is here::
